# S(H-N)AKE

This is a game made for [js13k](http://js13kgames.com)

It's a variantion of the classic *snake* game.

There are two modes:

	G: glitch-mode, each time you eat, some of your body parts are dispersed.
	
	S: swap-mode, each time you eat, two parts of the playing area swap their positions.

(because it was a simple idea, I change the constraint of the jam: all the game fit in one file <13Ko without be minified or zipped)
